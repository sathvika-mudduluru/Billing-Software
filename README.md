# Billing-Software

Python is used in this bill management system. Regarding this system's functionality, it simply has the admin portion. All orders, payments, and reports are managed by the administrator. Here, Python Tkinter is used to generate the GUI. The user can choose items from the menu and submit client information here. The menu items are shown by category in the software. After choosing at least one item, users can create bills. A bill appears in the "Bill Area" area of the system.
